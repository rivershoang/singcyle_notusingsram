# Synthesizable Single-Cycle RISCV-RV32I (tested on DE2)
The milestone for the CA class: Implementing RV32I on DE2. Thank you [my teammate](https://github.com/FinnNGrace) for supporting me throughout this project.
## Note
- Please explore the `doc`, `rtl`, and `tb` folders on your own.
- A higher version will be updated once I complete it.
